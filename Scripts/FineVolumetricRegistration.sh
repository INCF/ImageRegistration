# Here we will use ANTS to perform the Deformable registration of slices versus
# the 3D atlas.

#   Put here the scripts that Gang developed at UPenn...
#
#
# This will produce as output an set of CompositeTransforms (one per original slice)
# each combining a Deformation field with several Affine Transforms.
