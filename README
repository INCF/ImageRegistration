Digital Brain Atlasing

Digital brain atlases are essential tools in neuroscience research. They
function as references and analytical tools, and provide stable integration
frameworks as a basis for investigations of normal and abnormal brain structure
and function. Web-accessible brain atlases and spatial indices promise to
evolve into powerful tools for dynamic, multidimensional modes of scientific
interaction. The key aim of this INCF program is to coordinate and improve the
impact of atlasing projects, with a focus on the rodent brain.  Reference Data
- Waxholm Space

Waxholm Space is a coordinate-based reference space for the mapping and
registration of neuroanatomical data in the mouse brain. Image volumes
representing the canonical Waxholm Space (WHS) mouse brain can be downloaded
from the INCF Software Center. Servers hosting the Waxholm Space translation
services, which will enable scientists to register their own mouse data to the
standard Waxholm Space coordinates as well as provide translations among other
mouse brain atlases, have been set up the Royal Institute of Technology's
Supercomputer Center in Stockholm.
